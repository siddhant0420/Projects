# Projects

A machine learning project on calories burn prediction aims to develop a model that estimates the number of calories burned during physical activities based on various factors such as age, weight, height, and exercise intensity. This project typically involves data collection, preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation to achieve accurate predictions.

Project Overview:-

This project focuses on predicting the number of calories burned by individuals during physical activities. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model aims to provide accurate estimates based on various input features such as age, gender, weight, height, duration of exercise, heart rate, and body temperature.

KEY COMPONENTS :-
>> Datasets
>> Data Preprocessing
>> EDA(exploratory data analysis)
>> Model training
>> Building a predictive system

Conclusion:-
            This project not only demonstrates the application of machine learning in the health and fitness domain but also provides                 valuable insights for individuals looking to monitor their calorie expenditure. By understanding the factors that influence 
            calorie burn, users can make informed decisions to optimize their exercise routines and achieve their fitness goals.
